      This project automates manifest processing from Liquidity Services using Python and Selenium, significantly speeding up item lookup for auctions. It has reduced product research and data compilation time from 15 minutes to just 1 minute per manifest. The Auto Ad Poster utilizes this compiled data to swiftly post items on platforms like Facebook and Kijiji, achieving 30 listings in minutes, a task that previously took over two hours manually. The project also features an Instagram Auto Poster that seamlessly updates my business page with current inventory, keeping customers informed about the latest products for sale.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
### Here's why I created this project:
* Improved product research and data compiling allowing for less time to be invested with the same return
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over
* implements DRY principles to my business


## Step 1, Sourcing

Having sourced furniture from [Liquadation.com](https://www.liquidation.com/index?gclid=CjwKCAjwnrjrBRAMEiwAXsCc40uSxzQCMHP_9XwiY_rmfUpJ4WB1EDi4zOMVMNMTv_jmsZp39XRB5xoCpfIQAvD_BwE), I recognized that there was a significant time drain in manual product research of manifests. Using Python and Selenium, I extended and applied this to my business to create the Manifest Scrapper. This tool parses a .CSV file, efficiently searching and retrieving details for each product listed in Liquidity Services manifests. Reducing the processing time per manifest from 15 minutes to just 1 minute.


Here is a full demo of Manifest Scrapper taking in user input (the name of the manifest file) and rapidly looking up each product.

## Step 2, Positing listings

Next, the listings are posted to Kijiji and Facebook Marketplace
